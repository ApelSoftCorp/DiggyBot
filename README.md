# OpenComputer Lib

## HOW TO
see this [repo](https://github.com/Pixailz/OpenComputer) for more help

## TODO

1. refac code
1. try to fix dumb soft movement. maybe stop direction when changing_dir()
1. better tool management
   - `["pickaxe"] = {"Pickaxe", "pickaxe"}`
   - `["block"] = {"Stone", "Dirt"}`

1. check and react for the state, as a back_to_base
   - one tool left, need to refill on next back_to_base
   - inventory full, need to deposit on next back_to_base
   - low energy, need imediate back_to_base
